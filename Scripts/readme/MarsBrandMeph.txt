================================================================
This is the new and improved Mars Mephisto Script. 
Killing Mephisto has never before been so profitable. 
It includes updated d2jsp 0.31 compatibility and a host of 
new features and rewritten code.
================================================================

Version 0.99d (29.03.2003)

* Fixed weapon switch
* Hacked a fix for set rings problem

Let me know if there are crashing problems when buying or selling.

The script is now finished. I do not plan to do any further work on it.

For those curious about the new settings, I will answer questions in
the forum. The average character should not have to modify the dodge
options, unles they wish to disable dodging. About speed: the new
attacking should not be much slower than the old routies, if at all,
but if you wish to use the old bot it can be found at 
http://www.angelfire.lycos.com/in4/eimaj/MBM_D.1.zip.

Todo:

* Adaptive lag calculations based on me.ping or other measurements
* Avoidance when pathing/portaling/fighting
* Track down cast failures, other problems
* See if I can improve pathing some more, make it configurable
* Dodging
* Dodging
* Dodging
* Dodging
* Pathing
* Pathing
* Run timer
* Log wiping on a new version
* NPC delays
* dodge/hit counter -- requires a core bug to be fixed, need try 0.31
* gem cubing/crafting (maybe)
* night lord killing option

Things I plan to improve in the future:

Multi-language support
Fix remaining bugs
Add user requests, or changes anyone makes for me

Welcome to the next release of Mephisto Slaughter Script 2000.

// History Log /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Version 0.99c (29.03.2003)

* Added some timeouts in several event loop places
* Repeatedly attempts to detect Mephisto after TP
* Fixed possible problem with 2+ TP tomes
* Changed buying and selling items
* Redid pathing again, let me know if it works
* TP to stash if inventory is full (requested)
* German and French translations added
* Minor things, like a reduced attack range

Version 0.99b (23.03.2003)

* Fixed skill switch bug which may have been causing RD
* Hopefully fixed Mephisto not detected after TP

Version 0.99a (21.03.2003)

* Fixed crash if no space in inventory when moneymaking
* Fixed not stashing unid charms
* Fixed bug where repair check included inventory items
* Changed core delay to 20 ms
* Minor changes
* Modified town pathing again

Version 0.99 (19.03.2003)

* Changing in town pathing a bit, should fix Hratli
* Added uber chest opening for classic (requested)
* Converted constants to the Sy_Constants library
* Added ShopIt, NPCs are configurable (requested)
* Changed how the script teleports through Durance 2 (again)
* Fixed problem with full rejuv potions
* Removed run to Durance Entrace option, it was crappy
* Added support for untimed spells other than nova
* Adding calculations for casting delays
* Made some tweaks to the pathing speed. Need feedback!!!
  Paths will be a little rougher now. Not always optimal.
  Also restored the option to use simple pathing
* Fixed lockup when meph was outside nova range
* Fail cast spams should be stopped, only printing once
* Dodging now accounts cast rate and lag. More to do here.
* Fixed some things with run to town chickening
* Added a configurable money maker mode

Version D.4 (17.03.2003)

* Fixed the inventory free space detection for left-aligned charms
* Fixed a serious bug if no attack point was found
* Fixed the gold pickup
* Fixed teleporting to stairs for high-ping users, thanks snoop_tal
* Fixed bug where static was being cast even if out of range
* Improvements to attacking position calculations
* Added a new "Safety" feature for weak sorcs
* Other minor changes

Version D.3 (16.03.2003)

* Added a chicken to town and heal option
* Added chickens for when superunique monsters like Bremm 
  Sparkfist get too close. Useful for hardcore characters.
* Autodetects difficulty and selects a best potion type
* Added a few options and hidden things
* Added sweet progress bars from snoop_tal. Modified them some.
* PATHING IS PERFECT! (or close) I used a modified A* algorithm
  written into mattlant's lib. Instead of searching the grid,
  it checks for various places it can teleport to, and tries to
  minimize the number of teleport jumps. After all, a short 
  teleport takes just as much time as a long one.
  I haven't personally got Mattlant's permission to do this, 
  I hope he doesn't mind!
* Fixed a debugging print bug in mbm_Include, thanks syadasti

Version D.2 (14.03.2003)

* Completely rewrote attacking routines. Thanks Mattlant for the 
  useful mlHeap library; everything is completely delay() free now. 
  The dodging should be near-perfect once the delay variables are
  tuned properly.
* Added a wait for conviction aura that was requested
* Added a new way to handle low mana: by dodging meph's spells
* Added a method of dodging that uses trigonometry
* Changed dodging configuration to use two variables, read settings.d2l
* Weapon switch should work now
* No more dependancy on TownMove.d2l
* Added Static Field autorange calculation
* Fixed bugs in the life watch routine
* Added many delays and timeouts. Hopefully the ID scroll problem will
  disappear, let me know asap if it comes back.
* Added a variety of expert settings which you are free to mangle to
  kill your characters and crash your diablo. IE dont touch them.
* Made everything use constant strings in preparation for translation.
* Many other changes

Version D.1 (06.03.2003)

* Improved attack routines now have a much better chance of
  catching Meph in a static field or a nova. Don't forget to
  set your static field range in MBM_Settings.d2l, higher
  skill levels have broader ranges.
* Implemented stubs for mlMap pathing, which is much more
  accurate. Warning: may cause lag on slow computers, and
  potentially may even crash diablo.
* Fixed the enchant merc bug
* Fixed the HUD
* Fixed the logging not working bug
* No more dependency on BMPwnIt! The only one left now is TownMove.
* Other minor changes.

Version D (05.03.2003)

Things I improved in this release:

* Totally rewritten attack routines: now uses a modular pseudo-event based scheme 
  influenced by Mattlant's priority queue bot
* All the same options as the previous script, such as merc kill, weapon switch, dodging
* New 0.30 features such as item selling
* A totally rewritten potion library based on the pwnpots library
* New options for stash size and mana recovery for classic players and weak characters
* Removed dependency on PwnageXtreme
* Faster and deadlier than ever

Changes in C.2:
* Fixed spelling of Fire Wall in config
* Added option to unload pickit
* Added a way to try and let the merc kill mephisto
* Setting to chicken when out of full healing pots
* Added option to disable dodging
